# CloudMonitR Sample #

The CloudMonitR sample demonstrates how a Windows Azure Cloud Service can be instrumented so that developers using Windows Azure Cloud Services can have a view into how their application is performing in real-time. Using Performance Counter data reported in various charts in an HTML 5 dashboard and trace data that's displayed in a web browser window, application owners can continually see how instances are performing and using resources so that they'll better understand when their applications may need to be scaled.
